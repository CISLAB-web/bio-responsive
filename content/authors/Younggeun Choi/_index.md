Younggeun Choi is a Professor in the Department of Computer Engineering at Dankook University, where he leads research at the intersection of assistive robotics, human–computer interaction, wearable/ubiquitous sensing, and extended reality (XR)–based rehabilitation. His group develops intelligent systems that improve motor recovery and daily accessibility, including robotic platforms, wrist-worn activity tracking, palm-worn text input, and mixed-reality training environments. Prior to joining academia, he worked as a researcher at Locus Inc. (1998–2000) and later served as Founder & CTO of Neofect Inc. He is also a member of the Listing Committee of the Korea Exchange (since 2021). He received his Ph.D. (2010) and M.S. (2005) in Computer Science from the University of Southern California, and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Aerospace Engineering from KAIST (1997).
